needs to be done:
learning:
1. open cv emphasizing 3d graphics
2.1 read articles and paper about 3d reconstruction.
2.2 a little use of blender (do I need to get to the level of trying to redo 3d scene from 2d image?) - keep blender aside for the moment.
3. have some fun with nlp including learning how to obtain a page from a web and parsing the html of it and so on..
4. neural network again..
5. 3d classification?
6. keep with writing ideas and maybe try to break down so we will have some pieces that can be done (small ones).
