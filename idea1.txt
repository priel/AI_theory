my main Idea regarding AI is that understanding starts from the 3D world.

you can see a baby learn first the object in the physical work how they react and then try to construct 3d model of the physical world in their mind.
this has strong connection to NLP where each noun should represent a real physical object (kids don't understand the more spiritual meaning of nouns, later nouns can be also represented by actions and then these spiritual meaning will have an affect).
so the first intend and learn of the computer should be focus on objects this is the easy way to approach this.
later on there will come 4D where time also play a part, then links to actions are much more apprehended.
for example if you will say a simple sentence like "the man went to the store" the computer will draw a man any abstract model of a man (but in 3d representation) and it should "imagine" that man walking which is doing the simple movement of his legs that re-ordering his place from point A (anyway - hasn't been mentioned) to a store, which is also a noun that can be drew.
I still not sure what the representation should be like.
can it be a point cloud? which is much less intuitive to humans or should it be something like the triangle surface which is a bit more intuitively
